## Alert Summary

A SIEM alert was generated due to suspicious process execution activity on a Windows endpoint, indicating potential malware execution.

---

## Initial Assessment

- Alert severity: High  
- Alert type: Suspicious process execution  
- Affected system: Windows endpoint  
- Potential impact: Malware infection and system compromise  

Based on the severity and nature of the alert, immediate investigation was required.

## Investigation Steps

### Process Analysis
- Reviewed SIEM logs related to process creation events  
- Identified an unusual executable launched from a non-standard directory  
- Observed abnormal parent-child process relationships  

### Log Analysis
- Analyzed Windows Event Logs with focus on:
  - **4688** – Process creation  
- Reviewed command-line arguments associated with the process  

### Correlation
- Correlated process execution with user activity and timestamps  
- No legitimate software updates or administrative actions matched the activity

## Findings

- Suspicious process execution behavior consistent with malware  
- Execution occurred under a standard user context  
- Activity mapped to **MITRE ATT&CK technique T1059 (Command and Scripting Interpreter)**  

---

## Conclusion

The activity was confirmed as a **true positive malware execution incident**.

## Response & Recommendations

- Escalated the incident according to SOC procedures  
- Recommended isolating the affected endpoint  
- Advised running a full endpoint malware scan  
- Suggested reviewing email activity for potential phishing origin
